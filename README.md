# React Anti-Fraud Frontend

This is a client side\* frontend for my [Anti-Fraud System](https://github.com/dan-koller/Spring-Anti-Fraud-System) project. It is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) single page application that uses [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for routing. For the UI, it uses [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) and Axios for HTTP requests.

\*_There is a also a server side frontend available [here](https://github.com/dan-koller/Spring-Anti-Fraud-System/releases/) that is built with Thymeleaf. Note, that the server side frontend is not actively maintained and only available as additional download for the backend._

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
